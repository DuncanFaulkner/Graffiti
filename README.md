# Graffiti

A repository to experiment with using GitHub collaboratively.

The purpose of this repository is to experiment with forking, pulls,
pushes, issues, branches, and any other button/feature on GitHub.
I am making an initial print statement in a Python 3 file.

Oh, and you can change or respond to other people's items, but
leave at least their initial "I was here" comment.  I will attempt
to approve these items as fast as possible.
